Description: Normalization and differential abundance testing for microbiome counts data. Based on the method of Brill, Amir and Heller (2019). The package consists of two main functions: one function for selection of reference taxa for normalization, and a second function for normalizing counts according to the taxa selected and testing for differential abundance. The DS-FDR method for multiplicity correction (Jiang et al. 2017) is implemented as a part of the multiple testing procedure.
